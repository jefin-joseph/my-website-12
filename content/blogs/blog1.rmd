My name is Jefin Joseph. 
And I'm a Masters in Analytics and Management student at London Business School.

Before LBS, I worked for a London-based content marketing agency. My expertise lies in writing and optimizing long-form articles for Saas, fintech, and automobile clients. Prior to that, I was a software engineer at IQVIA, working on data migration testing and master data management project development.

I look forward to my time here!
